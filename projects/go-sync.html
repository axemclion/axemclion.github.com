        Outlook to Google Calendar syncing is nothing new, Google already has a <a href = "http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=89955">sync software</a>
        for this.The only problem with that package is that it does not sync selectively; all information from my outlook goes on to Google Servers. This is something that will not go down well with the policy makers at my job. If only the software allowed the user to select the fields that need to be synced.

        To install
        <ol>
            <li>
                Download the zip file and unzip it at a location where you wish to install it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Navigate to the bin location and open google.properties file
            </li>
            <li>
                Enter your google email id.
            </li>
            <li>
                Do NOT enter the password. It will be encoded and written to the file the first time the program is executed
            </li>
            <li>
                If you want you password to be saved, leave google.password.save=true. Else, change it to false.
            </li>
            <li>
                Setup your mobile on Google Calendar. Some tips here.
            </li>
            <li>
                Run gosync.bat
            </li>
            <li>
                To ensure that your outlook and Google Calendar are synchronized, put the bat in your startup folder or use Windows Task Scheduler to schedule sync cycles.
