        GMail Burglar Alarm is a gadget that you can add to your standard Gmail web interface to record your gmail sessions. Additionally, it also analyzes details of all sessions (like IP address, browser type, etc) and tries to determine if a session was suspicious. If the percentage of suspicion is high, you are alerted via a text message to the mobile number configured in your Google calendar. All the data stays with you and is stored on your Google Calendar. 
        <br/>
        The data is stored in a new calendar created on Google Calendar. This calendar is private to you and has details like IP address of login, HTTP Headers, browser version, etc. The gadget also displays the total time you spend on gmail, etc. The gadget analyzes recent sessions and tries to establish a pattern. Anything that is way out of this pattern is potentially dangerous and you are alerted.
