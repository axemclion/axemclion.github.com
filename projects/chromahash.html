        On a webpage, password fields obscure your input with â€¢'s to mask them from shoulder surfers. At times, even the users are not sure if they have typed the password correctly. 
        Chroma-Hash is an experiment that displays a variety of visualization so you can instantly see if your password is right. Chroma-Hash takes an MD5 hash of your input and uses that to compute the visualization. 
        <br/>
        The MD5 hash is non-reversible, so no one could know what your password just from the colors.
