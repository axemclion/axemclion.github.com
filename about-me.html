                on the internet. The nickname is his attempt to transliterate his full name into english.
            </p>
            <p>
                He likes working on Rich Internet Applications and has worked on Javascript, CSS, HTML, AJAX, Flash and Laszlo. He usually uses Java at the backend, with help from Freemarker, JSPs, etc and learnt Python to get his applications running with the Google App Engine. He usually uses MySql with Hibernate to persist data with the help of frameworks like Spring.

                He graduated as a BTech in Information Technology from <a href = "http://tce.edu/">Thiagarajar College of Engineering</a>
                (Anna University), Madurai and since then, has worked at places including <a href = "http://trilogy.com/">Trilogy</a>
                and <a href = "http://rsa.com">RSA Security</a>. 
                He has also helped <a href = "http://ugenie.com">Ugenie</a>, <a href = "http://coreobjects.com/">Core Objects</a>, <a href = "http://pustak.co.in">Pustak</a>, <a href= "http://www.tiriyo.com/">Tiriyo</a>

                When he is not at the computer, he spends his time with his lovely wife, listening curiously about her totally different world of dentistry, trying to grasp its nuances. :)

                He read somewhere that

                    life would be great if it was open-sourced by the creator

                but wonders if we humans could even understand the complex logic, let alone trying to set up a build environment and compile it.
